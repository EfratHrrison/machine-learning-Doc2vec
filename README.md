# machine-learning-Doc2vec

I  use Doc2vec algorithm to perform sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews.
The objective is to construct a model capable to predict review star rating from the text alone. 
I run the models:  Logistic Regression, Random Forest and tree_classifier.
I compered the modeles and the number of clusters each model has.
Trained and use word2vec for the same data. Compute mean of the vectors that represent the
words in each document to obtain document vectors.
Evaluate performance of the sentiment analysis classifier.
